<h5>Credential of clients?</h5>

<h5>The Process of Cashless Admission</h5>

If hospitalization is advised, the IQRAA Insurance desk may be contacted with a TPA ID card. IQRAA insurance desk will send the details in the format prescribed by empanelled TPA / Insurance company in the Pre-authorisation request form. Pre authorization has two sections,
Section 1: Details of your Health Insurance policy – To be filled by self (The Help Desk will assist you in case you have any difficulty).
Section 2: Pertains to the treatment recommended for you – Needs to be filled in and duly signed by the Doctor who is treating you (Do not attempt to fill this section, contact the Insurance Help Desk in case of any difficulty).
The personnel at the desk will verify the form for its correctness and let you know in case of any discrepancies.
On receipt of the pre-authorization request, TPA / Insurance company according to the health insurance policy coverage will issue the authority letter(AL) (Guarantee of payment Letter)The ID cards issued to the members of TPA / Insurance company’s are just to confirm the identity of the patient.
It is advisable to keep TPA / Insurance company informed of the primary diagnosis, duration of sickness or illness past history of the sickness, similar, related and relevant sickness, disease or disorder, any history of diabetes or hypertension.
The identification of the coverage will be done by TPA / Insurance company and eligibility will be informed in the form of an authority Letter (A/L) (Guarantee or Payment Letter).
A/L is a precursor to the confirmation of the credit facility to the beneficiary by the TPA / Insurance company without which IQRAA will not extend the credit facility.The IQRAA Insurance desk acts as only a facilitator between the policyholder and the TPA/Insurance company. Working hours:9.00 am to 5.30 pm
At the time of discharge, the IQRAA Insurance desk will send the final bill and discharge summary to the respective TPA to confirm the status of the initial authorization letter/ enhancement of the amount.

Normally it will take a minimum of 4hours to get the reply from the concerned TPA after sending the discharge summary and final bill. However, you may if you wish make the payment and get the reimbursement subsequently.
