            Patients willing for admission (24 hours minimum stay is mandatory) are identified on the basis of the ID cards issued by the TPA/Insurance company. 
            The consultant will assess the need for hospitalization. If hospitalization is not required, the patients will be treated on an OPD basis, and the fees will be collected from the patient directly. 
            TPA/Insurance company will not pay such fees.
        </p>

        <h5 class="text-info">The Process of Cashless Admission</h5>
        <p>
            If hospitalization is advised, the IQRAA Insurance desk may be contacted with a TPA ID card. IQRAA Insurance desk will send the details in the format prescribed by empanelled TPA/Insurance company in the Pre-authorization request form.
        </p>
        <ul class="list-unstyled">
            <li><strong>Section 1:</strong> Details of your Health Insurance policy – To be filled by self (The Help Desk will assist you in case you have any difficulty).</li>
            <li><strong>Section 2:</strong> Pertains to the treatment recommended for you – Needs to be filled in and duly signed by the Doctor who is treating you (Do not attempt to fill this section, contact the Insurance Help Desk in case of any difficulty).</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            The personnel at the desk will verify the form for its correctness and let you know in case of any discrepancies. On receipt of the pre-authorization request, TPA/Insurance company according to the health insurance policy coverage will issue the authority letter (AL) (Guarantee of payment Letter).
            The ID cards issued to the members of TPA/Insurance company’s are just to confirm the identity of the patient.
        </p>
        <p>
            It is advisable to keep TPA/Insurance company informed of the primary diagnosis, duration of sickness or illness, past history of the sickness, similar, related and relevant sickness, disease or disorder, any history of diabetes or hypertension.
        </p>
        <p>
            The identification of the coverage will be done by TPA/Insurance company and eligibility will be informed in the form of an authority Letter (A/L) (Guarantee or Payment Letter).
            A/L is a precursor to the confirmation of the credit facility to the beneficiary by the TPA/Insurance company, without which IQRAA will not extend the credit facility.
        </p>
        <p>
            The IQRAA Insurance desk acts as only a facilitator between the policyholder and the TPA/Insurance company. Working hours: 9.00 am to 5.30 pm
        </p>
        <p>
            At the time of discharge, the IQRAA Insurance desk will send the final bill and discharge summary to the respective TPA to confirm the status of the initial authorization letter/enhancement of the amount.
            Once the doctor advises discharge, please inform the IQRAA Insurance desk, which will help to speed the discharge procedure.
            Normally, it will take a minimum of 4 hours to get the reply from the concerned TPA after sending the discharge summary and final bill. However, you may, if you wish, make the payment and get the reimbursement subsequently.
            Insurer/TPA will not pay what is not covered under the insurance policy. Therefore the patient has to pay the amount of such services (Non-medical expenses) even though the full amount of approval is received from the TPA.
