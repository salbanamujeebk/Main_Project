                <p>The vision ‘affordable, accessible and quality healthcare for all’, a dream of visionary, Dr. K G Alexander was made a reality in 1987 with the commencement of Baby Memorial Hospital (BMH). The novel initiative then marked a revolution in the healthcare segment in Kerala, thus symbolizing an answer for the growing healthcare demands of the state. A tribute to late K C Varghese (known as ‘Baby’), father of Dr. K G Alexander,
                the Chairman and Managing Director, the hospital has set a benchmark in offering unprecedented care.</p>
                <p>With only 52 beds when started, the hospital now boasts world‐class amenities, which includes:</p>
                <ul class="list">
