    <h4 class="mt-5">How to Get Palliative Care?</h4>
    <p>The first step is to talk to your own doctor. Most of the time, you have to ask your doctor for a palliative care referral to get palliative care services. Whether you are in the hospital or at home, a palliative care team can help you. Following are some tips to help you talk to your doctor:</p>
    <ul class="list-group">
        <li class="list-group-item">Tell your doctor you are thinking about palliative care, and ask where palliative care is available in your area.</li>
        <li class="list-group-item">Ask your doctor to explain your illness and any past, current, and future treatments and procedures.</li>
        <li class="list-group-item">Explain to your doctor exactly what quality of life means to you. This list may include: being able to spend time with loved ones; relief from any pain and other symptoms; having the ability to make your own decisions for care and where you want to be treated (home vs. in the hospital).</li>
        <li class="list-group-item">Be sure your doctor is aware of any personal, religious, or cultural beliefs, values, or practices that are important to consider in your care and treatment decisions.</li>
        <li class="list-group-item">Tell your doctor which treatments you may or may not want.</li>
        <li class="list-group-item">Mention that you would like time to discuss future planning for your care. You should do this even if you’re well or it’s early in your illness.</li>
        <li class="list-group-item">If you have completed a living will or health care proxy, be sure to tell your doctor and provide him or her with a copy.</li>
        <li class="list-group-item">Finally, at any point in your illness if you are experiencing symptoms and stress, ask your doctor for the palliative care referral!</li>
    </ul>
